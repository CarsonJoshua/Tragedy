# 0 Tragedy Rules

## 0000.0 Interpretting Rules
* **0000.0.1** The rules of Tragedy provide the framework for how to use cards from other games in Tragedy, and so Tragedy rules take precedence.
* **0000.0.2** When two Tragedy rules conflict, the rule with the earlier decimal outline numbering takes precedence.  If the later rule is exceptional, it instead takes precedence.  A rule is exceptional if it describes an exception or a conditional where a new rule implies instead of the base rule.
* **0000.0.3** When two rule elements have the same name, they are the same rule element unless specified otherwise.
* **0000.0.4** The base rules of a game apply to cards of that game, except when in conflict with the Tragedy rules.
* **0000.0.5** Compatibility rules are lower precedence than the lower precedence of the two rules sets being made compatible.
